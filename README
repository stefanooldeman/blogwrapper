Ketchup!

please note: This app is in very early development.

important. to get everything up and running!
for now ive chosen to put the usage of very large libraries not under version control
to get the latest zend framewort. do the following:

$ cd lib 
$ git svn clone http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend
"note: you might see the following message:"
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/stefanooldeman/Sites/ketchup/lib/Zend/.git/
W: Ignoring error from SVN, path probably does not exist: (160013): Filesystem has no item: '/svn/framework/!svn/bc/100/standard/trunk/library/Zend' path not found
W: Do not be alarmed at the above message git-svn is just searching aggressively for old history.
This may take a while on large repositories
